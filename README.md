# Joga Poses Classification
The project aims to use deep learning capabilities to correctly classify yoga poses. Classification of 5 basic yoga positions such as warrior2, downdog, tree, goddass and plank was carried out. A VGG16 and ResNet50 neural network models were used to analyze and classify the yoga positions.

## Used Technologies 
- Language: Python 
- Libraries: PyTorch, Os, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Imageio

## How to run
1. Download data from Kaggle [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/niharika41298/yoga-poses-dataset/version/1)
2. Clone the repository.
3. Use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks to run `additional_channel_remove.ipynb` - it is necessary because some of the images have 4 channels instead of 3.
4. Next run `ResNet50_model.ipynb` or `VGG16_model.ipynb` file.

## Inspiration
The project was created as a part of the university subject Engineering Biomechanics.
